pims_nd2
========

This package lets [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims) interface with the [ND2SDK](http://www.nd2sdk.com) for fast reading of Nikon *.nd2 files.

This is implemented on Windows, Linux and OSX systems.

Dependencies
------------

This reader is based on `pims.FramesSequenceND`, which is available from version 0.3. Apart from [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims) there are no extra dependencies. The required c libraries are included and will be added to the PATH variable at runtime.

Examples
--------

The following code opens the demo file included in the package and iterates through the first 3 frames. Note that frames are only read when necessary.

    from pims_nd2 import ND2_Reader
    with ND2_Reader('cluster.nd2') as frames:
		frames.iter_axes = 't'
		frames.bundle_axes = 'zyx'
		frames.default_coords['c'] = 1
		for frame in frames[:3]:
			# do something with 3D frames in channel 1

The best way to use the reader is using a context manager. If you do not use a context manager, make sure to call `frames.close()` at the end of your script.

Metadata access can be done on two levels: reader level and frame level.

	frames.metadata['mpp']  # calibration in microns per pixel
	frames[0].metadata['t_ms']  # time of frame in milliseconds
